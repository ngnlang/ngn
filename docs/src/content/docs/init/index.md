description: What is ngn?
---

Pronounced "engine", ngn is a high-level programming language designed to create APIs, MCP servers, and serve AI purposes like LLM inference. It's intended to be easily learned and dearly loved. It draws inspiration from many other languages, with some unique modifications here and there.

## What you can expect

A few highlights of ngn:

- concurrency and parallelism
- straight-forward async code via threads and channels
- concise await syntax, with no contagion
- shared, atomic state when needed
- built-in http/s server

:::note
I've driven the vision for ngn, and put a lot of thinking time into it's features, naming conventions, and syntax, but AI has written nearly 100% of the code - which I've reviewed _nearly_ all of.

Fear? That's someone else's problem.
