title: Deploy
---

Right now, you'll need your own server to deploy an ngn app.

1. Install ngn to your server.
2. Build your app locally - `ngn build main.ngn`
3. Copy the resulting `main.mod` file to your server.
4. Start your app with `ngnr run main.mod`

In the future, I hope that hosting platforms will support running ngn apps. Or maybe I'll need to create my own platform.
